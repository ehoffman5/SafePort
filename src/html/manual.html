        <h3><strong>What is a port?</strong></h3>
        <br/>
        <p>A port is a place in your computer where a connection to a network can be made.  Your computer, and all devices that can access the internet, have 65,535 of these ports.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3><strong>What is a port scan?</strong></h3>
        <br/>
        <p>A port scan is when a piece of software like SafePort sends connection requests to every port and determines whether or not each port is closed based on the response.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3><strong>What is an open port?</strong></h3>
        <br/>
        <p>An open port is a port in which a connection can be made.  In some cases, an open port is running a service.  This means that it is too busy for it to be exploited by hackers; but, if there are open ports that are not running services, a hacker can gain access to your device.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3><strong>How do I scan my device?</strong></h3>
        <br/>
        <p>SafePort makes it easy to scan your device with a single click. We have 3 options for scanning: Smart Scan, Full Scan, and Custom Scan.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3><strong>What is a Smart Scan?</strong></h3>
        <br/>
        <p>Smart Scan is a faster scan that only checks a list of 70 of the most commonly exploited ports.  This is a good first scan to do as it provides important information very quickly; however, it might not catch all of your open ports.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3><strong>What is a Full Scan?</strong></h3>
        <br/>
        <p>Full Scan checks every single port on your device and lets you know which ones are open.  This is a longer scan.  For most devices, it takes about 5-10 minutes to complete.  This will definitively show you every open port on your device.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3><strong>What is a Custom Scan?</strong></h3>
        <br/>
        <p>Custom Scan is an advanced version of Full Scan that lets you scan foreign devices that you own (like web servers or any websites you own) instead of just scanning the device you are on.  Depending on how much processing power your device has, you can also adjust the threading of the scan to be lower or higher.  A lower thread rate makes the scan take longer, but it is easier on the device.  Higher threading makes the scan go faster, but is harder on your device.</p>
