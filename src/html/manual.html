        <h3>Welcome to SafePort! You have just taken your first step to having a safer computer! Now let’s start with the basics:</h3>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>What is a port?</strong></p>
        <br/>
        <p>A port is a place in your computer where a connection can be made. Your computer, and all devices that can access the internet, have 65,535 of these ports.</p>
        <br/>
        </p><strong>What is a port scan?</strong></p>
        <br/>
        <p>A port scan is when a piece of software like SafePort sends connection requests to every port and determines whether or not each port is closed based on the response.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>What is an open port?</strong></p>
        <br/>
        <p>An open port is a port in which a connection can be made, in some cases an open port is running a service so it is too busy for it to be dangerous but if there are open ports that are not running services a hacker can gain access to your device.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>How do I scan my device?</strong></p>
        <br/>
        <p>SafePort makes it easy to scan your device with a single click. We have 3 options for scanning.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>What is Smart Scan?</strong></p>
        <br/>
        <p>Smart Scan is a faster scan that only checks a list of 70 of the most commonly exploited ports. This is a good first scan to do as it gives a lot of information very quickly, however, it might not catch all of your open ports</p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>What is Full Scan?</strong></p>
        <br/>
        <p>Full Scan checks every single port and lets you know which ones are open. This is a longer scan and for most devices it takes about 5-10 minutes to complete. This will give you every open port.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>What is Custom Scan?</strong></p>
        <br/>
        <p>Custom scan is a more advanced version of Full scan that let’s you scan devices you own (like web servers) or any websites you own instead of just scanning the device you are on. Depending on how much your device can handle you can also adjust the threading to be lower or higher. (Lower makes the scan take longer but is easier on the device, Higher makes the scan go faster but is harder on your device)</p>
